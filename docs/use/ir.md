# IR gateway
There is two methods for finding the IR codes you want to replicate:
1. Point the remote control to an IR receiver see [Receiving data from IR signal](#receiving-data-from-ir-signal) & [Send data by MQTT to convert it on IR signal](#send-data-by-mqtt-to-convert-it-on-ir-signal)
2. Find the code corresponding to your devices with IR global cache database https://irdb.globalcache.com/ see [Send data by MQTT from Global cache database to convert it on IR signal](#send-data-by-mqtt-from-global-cach%C3%A9-database-to-convert-it-on-ir-signal)

Here is the [List of protocols](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rTDZIG8rm0dSf4vP7HdTdM4-aRY1nDWH4jK28_WRwHQ/edit?usp=sharing) supported by OMG, even if your device brand is not in the list you can still use raw IR data or GlobalCache database.

## Receiving data from IR signal
Subscribe to all the messages with mosquitto or open your MQTT client software:
`mosquitto_sub -t +/# -v`
And press your IR remote control in front of the receiver led you should see the following messages for example:

```
home/OpenMQTTGateway/IRtoMQTT {"value":875849879,"protocol":7,"protocol_name":SAMSUNG,"bits":32,"raw":"4534,4432,612,518,614,516,616,1618,618,1616,618,512,618,1618,608,524,612,518,616,514,618,512,616,1618,616,1618,618,514,616,1618,616,514,616,514,618,512,616,1618,618,1618,618,514,610,1622,616,514,618,514,614,516,616,1618,618,512,618,512,618,1616,550,580,618,1616,612,1624,618,1616,618"}
```

To receive big dump of raw data you need first to modify the [config_IR.h](https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway/blob/091b317660fd201a30e2cd0e15424a13c5a6bd71/config_IR.h#L41) and uncomment DumpMode true

Unknown protocols are filtered by default, if you want to see the unknown protocols set into [config_IR.h](https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway/blob/master/config_IR.h)
`#define pubIRunknownPrtcl true` instead of false

![](https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway/blob/master/img/OpenMQTTGateway_serial3.jpg)

You can take this code and try to reproduce it with the gateway either by using [decimal value](#send-data-by-mqtt-to-convert-it-on-ir-signal) or the [raw value](#send-raw-ir-data-by-mqtt).

## Send data by MQTT to convert it on IR signal 
With the IR gateway you need to put on the topic the protocol_name you want to use to send the signal, the different protocols implemented are [here](https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/blob/f9d7e5c622670132731e3f9c64d9132128eb320c/src/IRremoteESP8266.h#L299)

Exhaustive list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_5fQjAixzRtepkykmL-3uN3G5bLfQ0zMajM9OBZ1bx0/edit#gid=1910001295)

For example if I want to send a command to a sony TV you can use the following command:

`mosquitto_pub -t home/OpenMQTTGateway/commands/MQTTtoIR -m  '{"value":551489775,"protocol_name":"SONY"}'`

The code after the -m represent the payload you want to send.

If you don’t want to use special parameters for IR just use value key, the protocol per default is NEC

`mosquitto_pub -t home/OpenMQTTGateway/commands/MQTTtoIR -m  '{"value":551489775}'`

NOTE: on arduino Uno most of the protocols are not enable per default due to memory constraints (it is not the case for MEGA), to enable them go to [user_config.h](https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway/blob/master/main/User_config.h) and uncomment the #define corresponding the protocols you want:

```C++
//#define IR_COOLIX
//#define IR_Whynter
//#define IR_LG
//#define IR_Sony
//#define IR_DISH
//#define IR_RC5
//#define IR_Sharp
#define IR_SAMSUNG
```
## Send data by MQTT from Global Caché database to convert it on IR signal 

The website https://irdb.globalcache.com/ contains an important database of IR codes of various devices brand. By registering and asking the code you will receive a code as the example below:

```
code1: sendir,1:1,1,38000,1,69,340,169,20,20,20,20,20,64,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,64,20,64,20,20,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,1544,340,85,20,3663
```

Extract this part of the code:
```
38000,1,69,340,169,20,20,20,20,20,64,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,64,20,64,20,20,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,64,20,1544,340,85,20,3663
```

and publish it to mqtt with the a subject containing IR_GC:
```
mosquitto_pub -t home/OpenMQTTGateway/commands/MQTTtoIR -m '{"raw":"38000,1,1,171,171,21,64,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,64,21,64,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,64,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,64,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,64,21,64,21,64,21,21,21,64,21,64,21,64,21,64,21,1114","protocol_name":"IR_GC"}'
```

You should be able to command your devices without having listened with the IR receiver or if your protocol is unknown by the IRremote library

## Send data by MQTT with advanced IR parameters
IR sending support two advanced parameters; bits length and repeat number.

The example below will send the following advanced parameters bits: 14 and repeat:4 times for a sony protocol:
```
mosquitto_pub -t home/OpenMQTTGateway/commands/MQTTtoIR -m '{"value":551489775,"protocol_name":"NEC","repeat":4,"bits":14}'
```

## Send raw IR data by MQTT

2) If you use an arduino UNO enable `IR_Raw` by uncommenting the line 129 in user_config.h
`#define IR_Raw`
If you are using the uno you will have to comment other gateway like ZgatewayRF, ZgatewayBT and ZgatewayIR to keep enough memory

3) publish your code like below
```
mosquitto_pub -t home/OpenMQTTGateway/commands/MQTTtoIR -m '{"raw":"8850,4450,600,550,550,550,600,1600,600,550,600,500,600,500,600,550,600,500,600,1650,600,1600,600,550,600,1600,600,1650,600,1600,600,1650,600,1600,600,550,600,500,600,550,550,1650,600,500,600,550,600,500,600,550,550,1650,600,1650,550,1650,600,550,550,1650,600,1650,550,1650,600,1650,600","protocol_name":"IR_Raw"}'
```

## Repeat the IR signal OpenMQTTGateway receive
So as to repeat the IR signal received by the gateway once set the following parameter to true in [config_IR.h](https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway/blob/091b317660fd201a30e2cd0e15424a13c5a6bd71/config_IR.h#L37)
`#define repeatIRwMQTT true`
