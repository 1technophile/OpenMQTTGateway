OpenMQTTGateway aims to unify various technologies and protocols into a single firmware. This reduces the need for multiple physical bridges and streamlines diverse technologies under the widely-used [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) protocol.

# What is an MQTT gateway or bridge ?

MQTT, short for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, is a lightweight messaging protocol ideal for IoT devices.

An MQTT gateway or bridge plays a pivotal role in the MQTT ecosystem:
* Protocol Translation: It converts non-MQTT protocols (like LoRa or Bluetooth) into MQTT, enabling broader network communication.
* Data Aggregation: Combines data from multiple devices into single messages, optimizing network use.
* Security: Incorporates features like SSL/TLS encryption to safeguard data during transmission.
* Device Management: Handles tasks like firmware updates and remote configuration changes.

In essence, an MQTT gateway ensures smooth communication between devices and MQTT brokers, enhancing the efficiency and security of IoT systems.

# What OpenMQTTGateway can do ?

OpenMQTTGateway integrates with established technologies, such as 433mhz/315mhz protocols and infrared (IR), allowing you to upgrade and repurpose older devices. Additionally, OMG is compatible with modern technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LoRa.

To have an overview of the supported PIR, door, water, temperature, smoke sensors, sirens, rings, beacons, switches & weather stations you can take a look to the 
[compatible devices list](https://compatible.openmqttgateway.com/index.php/devices)

You can run OpenMQTTGateway on a wide variety of [boards](https://compatible.openmqttgateway.com/index.php/boards/), ESP32, ESP8266, Arduino MEGA, UNO (with limitation).
BLE to MQTT gateway can also run on Raspberry Pi, Windows or Unix computers thanks to [Theengs Gateway](https://theengs.github.io/gateway/).

Using MQTT, you can seamlessly integrate with home automation platforms such as OpenHAB, Home Assistant, and others, or with IoT software like Node-Red.

# Use cases
Leveraging OpenMQTTGateway with a controller allows you to:
* Monitor a garden with a Mi Flora BLE sensor and control an irrigation valve depending on the soil moisture,
* Trigger a fan depending on the temperature and humidity thanks to a Mi Jia/LYWSD03MMC BLE sensor,
* Follow your meat temperature when cooking with an Inkbird IBBQ
* Alert yourself by a controller notification if the temperature of a fridge or freezer is too high,
* Detect a beacon/smartwatch so as to trigger a special scenario when you come home,
* [Lose weight with the help of a complete log system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noUROhtf0E0&t=18s), video from [@Andreas Spiess](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ)
* Detect opened door or windows through 433mhz or BLE and alert yourself when leaving
* Detect water leakage or smoke remotely
* Actionate a siren if something is going wrong
* Detect if your far mailbox has been opened by the postman with LoRa
* Make smart your old TV or AC system through infrared control
* Monitor vehicle tire pressure

The limit is your imagination ðŸ˜€
