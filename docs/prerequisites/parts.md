# Parts
Depending on the gateway you would like to setup and your board, you may need extra parts/module to add.

You can take a look to the [OpenMQTTGateway compatible website](https://compatible.openmqttgateway.com) to have a view of the [supported parts](https://compatible.openmqttgateway.com/index.php/parts/).

Here is below the main parts reference.

Indeed for other parts we may not have it so as to reproduce the issue, or in the worst case they may not be compatible.
