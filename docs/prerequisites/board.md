# Board
OpenMQTTGateway is not closed to one board or type of board, by using the power of the Arduino framework and libraries that are cross compatibles it let you many choice of hardware, from an Arduino UNO to an ESP32.

You can take a look to the [OpenMQTTGateway compatible website](https://compatible.openmqttgateway.com) to have a view of the [supported boards](https://compatible.openmqttgateway.com/index.php/boards/).

Moreover the gateways capacities can be extended with sensors; DHT, HC SR501, ADC, I2C bus, INA226, TSL2561, BME280, HTU21D, AHTx0, DS1820
or actuators; LED, relays, PWM.

::: tip Running on a computer
If you want to use the BLE decoding capabilities of OpenMQTTGateway with a Raspberry Pi, Windows or Unix PC you can use [Theengs Gateway](https://gateway.theengs.io/).
:::

::: tip Running on a tablet or phone
If you want to use the BLE decoding capabilities of OpenMQTTGateway with a tablet or smartphone you can use [Theengs App](https://app.theengs.io/).

Here is some information to find the boards suitable for your need, you have the choice between off the shelves boards and DIY setup.

## Off the shelves boards
The boards below doesn't need hardware modification (or a lite one).

'(*)' *So as to extend the number of RF protocols supported by the Sonoff RF Bridge you can apply a [hardware hack](https://1technophile.blogspot.com/2019/04/sonoff-rf-bridge-pilight-or-how-to.html), this way you will be able to use RFm Pilight or RF2 gateway.*

## DIY boards
The boards below need hardware [parts](parts.md) and electronic/hardware competencies. You have more possibilities of gateways combination, compared to off the shelves ones.
|DIY boards|RF|IR|BLE|LORA|GSM|Button|Relay|

|ESP8266|X|X|-|not tested|X|X|X|

::: tip
Pilight is only supported on ESP, Arduino UNO handle only 32bits values in our context.
HM10 is no longer supported by OpenMQTTGateway

Arduino + ethernet shields enables faster responsiveness of the gateway and a reliable connection. 

The ESP platform is more flexible in term of installation (no need of an ethernet cable) but is less reliable in term of communication. Thanks to its higher memory and processing power it has more modules or possibilities compared to Arduino Uno & Mega.

Choosing your board depends heavily on the technologies you want to use with it.
To have a good overview of the compatibilities per board you can refer to the compatible modules attributes of each [board](https://compatible.openmqttgateway.com/index.php/boards/).

The choice between these boards will depend on your knowledge and your requirements in terms of reliability, situation, modules wanted and devices you already have.
