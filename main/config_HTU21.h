  Theengs OpenMQTTGateway - We Unite Sensors in One Open-Source Interface
 
   Act as a gateway between your 433mhz, infrared IR, BLE, LoRa signal and one interface like an MQTT broker
   Send and receiving command by MQTT
   
   This is the Climate Addon:
   - Measures Temperature, Humidity and Pressure
   - Generates Values for: Temperature in degrees C and F, Humidity in %, Pressure in Pa, Altitude in Meter and Feet
   - Required Hardware Module: HTU21
   - Required Library: SparkFun HTU21 Library v1.1.3

   Connection Schemata:
   --------------------

   HTU21 ------> ESP8266
