// Gamma defines a power curve that is applied to convert the input values
// to the linear PWM outputs.
// For LED control, the gamma can be used to make the inputs be more
// perceptually linear.
// For controlling other things that require strict linear control, set
// the gamma to 1 and leave it alone.
// This just defines the default gamma to use for all channels.
// The gamma for each channel can be modified using the calibrate MQTT topic.
