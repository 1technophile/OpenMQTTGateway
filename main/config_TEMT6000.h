/*  
  OpenMQTTGateway Addon  - ESP8266 or Arduino program for home automation 

   Act as a wifi or ethernet gateway between your 433mhz/infrared IR signal  and a MQTT broker 
   Send and receiving command by MQTT
 
   This is the Light Meter Addon based on modules with a TEMT6000:
   - Measures ambient Light Intensity in Lux (lx), Foot Candela (ftcd) and Watt/m^2 (wattsm2)
   - Required Hardware Module: TEMT6000
   - Dependencies: none

   Connection Scheme:
   --------------------

   TEMT6000 ----> ESP8266
   ==============================================
   Vcc ---------> 3.3V
   GND ---------> GND
   SIG ---------> A0
