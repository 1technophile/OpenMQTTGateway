### Theengs Plug, BLE gateway and Smart Plug

[Theengs plug](https://shop.theengs.io/products/theengs-plug-smart-plug-ble-gateway-and-energy-consumption) brings the following features:
* BLE to MQTT gateway, tens of [Bluetooth devices](https://compatible.openmqttgateway.com/index.php/devices/ble-devices/) supported thanks to Theengs Decoder library. The plug uses an ESP32 acting as a BLE to Wifi gateway to scan, decode and forward the data of the nearby sensors,
* Smart plug that can be controlled remotely,
* Energy consumption monitoring,
* Presence detection (beta).
