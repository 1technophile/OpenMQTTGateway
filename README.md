OpenMQTTGateway project goal is to concentrate in one firmware different technologies and protocols, decreasing by the way the number of physical bridges needed, and hiding the different technologies singularity behind a simple & wide spread communication protocol; MQTT.

## Documentation

The documentation is [here](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com)

The reference sheet, with the list of all functions, pinouts is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_5fQjAixzRtepkykmL-3uN3G5bLfQ0zMajM9OBZ1bx0/edit#gid=0)

## Upload

Upload OpenMQTTGateway directly from the [upload page](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com/upload/web-install.html) (no additional software required) or [build your own configuration](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com/upload/builds.html) with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) or [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)


## First ready to go OpenMQTTGateway device !

[Theengs plug](https://shop.theengs.io/products/theengs-plug-smart-plug-ble-gateway-and-energy-consumption) is available flashed with OpenMQTTGateway, and brings the functions below:
* BLE to MQTT gateway, tens of Bluetooth devices supported thanks to Theengs Decoder library. The plug uses an ESP32 acting as a BLE to Wifi gateway to scan, decode and forward the data of the nearby sensors,
* Smart plug that can be controlled remotely,
* Energy consumption monitoring,
* Presence detection (beta).

Support the project by purchasing the [Theengs plug](https://shop.theengs.io/products/theengs-plug-smart-plug-ble-gateway-and-energy-consumption)
The plug is available in North America only, other regions are planned.
